# Rent Example with Steel and Poseidon

This example demonstrates how rent works on Solana using the Steel and Poseidon frameworks. In this example, weâ€™ll explore how accounts can be made rent-exempt by holding enough balance and how to check if an account is rent-exempt.
Overview

In Solana, storage incurs a small rent fee, which is required to keep accounts active on the blockchain. However, if an account holds enough balance to cover rent for approximately two years, it becomes rent-exempt, meaning no rent is charged.

This example provides a simple demonstration of:

    Checking if an account has enough funds to be rent-exempt.
    Making sure accounts stay rent-exempt by providing adequate funding.

## Dependencies

To run this example, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

    Rust and Cargo: Install Rust
    Anchor: For Solana smart contract development.

    bash

cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --locked
avm install latest
avm use latest

Solana CLI: For interacting with the Solana blockchain.

bash

    sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.10.29/install)"

    Node.js and NPM: Required for running JavaScript or TypeScript tests.
        Install Node.js and npm from nodejs.org.

## Setup Instructions

    Clone the Repository
    Clone your fork of the Solana program-examples repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/Luckingz/program-examples.git
cd program-examples/basics/rent_example

Build the Program Run the following command to build the program:

bash

anchor build

Deploy the Program Deploy the program to your local Solana cluster (or to devnet if needed).

bash

    anchor deploy

## Running the Example

To run this example, use the following steps:

    Check Account Rent Exemption Status The example allows you to check if an account has sufficient balance to be rent-exempt.

    bash

    anchor test

    Expected Output
    The tests will validate:
        Whether an account is rent-exempt.
        If the account requires additional balance to achieve rent exemption.

    If the test passes, it confirms that the account is successfully validated for rent exemption.

## Testing

We have provided tests written in TypeScript to verify that the example works as expected. The tests:

    Check if an account meets rent exemption requirements.
    Confirm that accounts behave as expected under Solana's rent model.

To run the tests, use:

bash

anchor test

Notes

    Make sure you have a funded wallet on your local network to cover the transaction fees.
    Customize any rent values or exemption thresholds in tests/rent_example.ts based on your needs.
